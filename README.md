## Jammming

Jammming is a single page react app which allows the user to search spotify and create playlists. In order to run Jammming locally, you must also use my fork of mpj's OAuth bridge template which I used to allow users to login to spotify and authorize the app to add playlists to their account. That repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/AodenTeo/oauth-bridge-template.git">here.</a>

The app will expect that you are running it in production mode.
